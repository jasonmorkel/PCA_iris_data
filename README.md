Principal Component Analysis can be used to visualize big data with high dimensions to help you plot and understand the data better.

When faced with a large set of correlated variables, principle components allow us to summarize this set with a smaller number of representative variables that collectively explain most of the variability in the original set. 

The explained variance tells you how much information (variance) can be attributed to each of the principal components. This is important as while you can convert 4 dimensional space to 2 dimensional space, you lose some of the variance (information) when you do this. By using the attribute explained_variance_ratio_, you can see that the first principal component contains 72.77% of the variance and the second principal component contains 23.03% of the variance. Together, the two components contain 95.80% of the information.
